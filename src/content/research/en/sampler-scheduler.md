We propose an adaptive multistep sampling scheduler that improves diffusion model sampling efficiency and numerical stability. Our method achieves state-of-the-art FID performance with 30–40% reduction in sampling steps, accelerating image generation without compromising quality. An open-source Stable Diffusion WebUI plugin "Seniorious" is also released.
